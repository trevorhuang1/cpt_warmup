    "- Computing bias is a bias that exists within algorithms that unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups, creating unfair outcomes\n",
    "- Computing innovations reflect biases because algorithms and data are influenced by the people who contributed to it, so computing biases can be embedded at every level of development \n",
    "- Algorithm bias should be reduced so computer innovations can combat existing user bias\n",

    "B. A navigation app provides real-time traffic updates and alternate routes to users, considering various factors such as traffic volume, road closures, and weather conditions. <br>\n",
    "C. An image recognition algorithm identifies objects in photographs with high accuracy, regardless of the gender, ethnicity, or age of the individuals depicted.<br>\n",
    "D. An automated hiring system consistently favors candidates from specific educational institutions and backgrounds, resulting in the exclusion of qualified applicants from diverse backgrounds."

    "## Types of Computing Bias - Trevor\n",
    "Computing bias can be either intentional or unintentional and as said before, this bias is a result of human biases in development. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data bias: when the data set does not reflect the real world values\n",
    "    - Ex: A company is developing an algorithm to see whether or not a product has positive or negative online reviews. However, the training data might over-represent overly negative or positive opinions that are posted online which wouldn’t reflect the real-world popularity of the product\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Bias-Meaning.png\">\n",
    "- Human bias: People who make the programs may bring in their own biases whether consciously or unconsciously\n",
    "    - Ex: A software development team is working on a code review algorithm. They all have experience using Language X and so they believe that developers using Language X are more qualified and so their algorithm reflects that. This uses their individual traits and applies it to the entire group of coders using Language X.\n",
    "- Algorithmic bias reflects the data bias and human bias and often amplifies it. However, bias can arise from the structure and decision making of the program itself\n",
    "    - Ex: A program is designed to automate the loan approval system. It uses information from income, employment history, and credit score. However, the algorithmn can produce biased results based on trends from certain job occupations which may disproportionally affect certain groups\n",

    "- Explicit data is information you give an app or site\n",
    "- Implicit data is the information it collects based on your activity\n",
